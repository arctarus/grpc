# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

  * `StreamResponseProcess`: buffer is now fully drained when a single HTTP/2
    data frame contains multiple gRPC messages, preventing consumers from
    blocking unnecessarily while decoded data is already available in the
    process buffer. A new private `drain_buffer/5` recursive helper replaces
    the previous single-pass `GRPC.Message.get_message/2` call.
